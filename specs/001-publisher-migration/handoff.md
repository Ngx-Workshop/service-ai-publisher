# Publisher migration handoff

Implemented locally, 2026-11-06; production integration/cutover pending.

## Result

service-ai-publisher owns the complete former gateway publishing subtree, all four
skills, generation/image APIs, preparation checks, owner adapters and receipt/recovery
logic. The working-tree preflight diagnostics and no-paid-repair fixes were copied
before removing gateway implementation. Domain resources remain behind owner APIs.
The publisher seed CRUD, database dependency and stale e2e test were removed.

service-mcp-gateway now has only a fixed-destination compatibility forwarding adapter
for /publisher/tools and /mcp/publishing. Its catalog implementation/auth/ingress and
three read-only tools remain unchanged. Both legacy browser path and MCP tool shapes
are preserved. Gateway generated OpenAPI, discovery and contracts have no changes
against HEAD after regeneration. Independent publisher contracts 1.0.0 are generated;
the vendored tarball exactly matches their files. No registry publication occurred.

## Verification on Node 22.23.3

- Publisher clean npm ci --ignore-scripts: pass, using migrated gateway dependency pins.
  Initial seed-lock audit failed; replacing it with the existing gateway dependency
  graph removed those old high/critical findings without a broad package upgrade.
- Publisher strict build/OpenAPI/assets: pass; 57 unit tests and 5 MCP/HTTP tests pass.
- Gateway strict build: pass; 50 unit tests and 50 protocol/forwarding tests pass.
- Both non-mutating lint checks: pass; both generated contract builds: pass.
- Publisher package snapshot byte comparison: pass. Gateway generated-artifact
  no-diff gate: pass. Both git diff --check: pass.
- Publication workflow tests: 5 per service pass. Deployment tests: 6 publisher and
  5 gateway pass, including active legacy-writer rejection and rollback failures.
- Publisher production npm audit --audit-level=high: pass, with one inherited moderate
  @hono/node-server advisory remaining. No major dependency upgrade was attempted.

Tests use disposable auth/owner HTTP doubles, temporary private receipt directories
and official MCP clients. They make no paid provider calls. No live production,
real owner/model/storage, Docker-image build or SSH deployment was performed.

## Production handoff

Follow service-ai-publisher/docs/migration.md: drain preparation/publication, back up
the existing journal, provision root-owned 0600 publisher runtime.env, move server-only
model/authoring settings, configure gateway AI_PUBLISHER_BASE_URL, deploy gateway
without the journal mount, then publisher with the same ngx-publisher-runs volume.
Both services use ngx-net; publisher listens on private port 3014 without production
host port publication. Preparation jobs do not survive restart; receipt formats and
request ownership do. Never run two journal writers, including during rollback.

Existing frontend need not change paths or contract imports. A future frontend can
adopt @tmdjr/service-ai-publisher-contracts with mcpPublisherContract; gateway keeps
its historical mcpCatalogContract.publishing export. Npm OIDC for the new package,
host environment provisioning, live administrator/receipt checks and real runner/model
acceptance remain operational rollout work. No commit, push, publication or deployment
was performed by this migration task.

## Deployment failure follow-up — 2026-11-06

Run 42302561829 completed validation/publication, then failed promotion because
/etc/ngx-workshop/ai-publisher/runtime.env was missing. Read-only SSH confirmed this
and found all required publisher settings in the existing root-private gateway file.
The host still runs gateway revision 4d00fe26a30ca4188e197ed893e6c1125565152a
with ngx-publisher-runs mounted; the publisher container remains the seed image.

Added first-deployment runtime initialization with exclusive create, allowlisted
settings, mode/ownership validation and no existing-file changes. Missing settings and
Docker prerequisites now report safe actionable errors. `--prepare-runtime` can run
without artifacts or promotion; that tested helper was used over verified SSH to
stage the new private file. No service restart, image promotion or workflow rerun
was performed. Twelve deployment/runtime tests pass. The gateway migration remains
uncommitted in its local checkout and must reach deployment before publisher
promotion can pass the receipt single-writer guard. See docs/migration.md.

## Production cutover completed — 2026-11-06

Gateway run 42306873767 originally failed because the host runtime lacked
AI_PUBLISHER_BASE_URL. Publisher run 42304355840 correctly rejected the legacy
active journal writer. Verified host inspection showed no other gateway required
configuration mismatch.

Backed up both private runtime files and the existing receipt volume under root-only
/etc/ngx-workshop/releases/publisher-cutover-20261106T225004Z. Added the fixed private
publisher destination to gateway runtime without changing its other settings. Retried
the validated gateway deploy, verified its receipt mount was gone, then retried the
validated publisher deploy. Both succeeded. After comparing the migrated settings
with publisher runtime, removed the obsolete model/authoring settings from gateway
runtime, backed up that pre-cleanup file and repeated gateway deployment successfully.

Final running images:
- gateway: service-mcp-gateway:ci-42306873767-3 (commit a923a2680cb174906a50370117099ca3c852e3a6)
- publisher: service-ai-publisher:ci-42304355840-2 (commit 04100e795bc33d55fc2850a08cba75f57feec95b)

Exactly one running container mounts ngx-publisher-runs: service-ai-publisher. Its
uid 1000 process can read/write the existing directory. Gateway has neither a journal
mount nor OPENAI_API_KEY; publisher retains its private model key. Stopped rollback
containers and root-private backups remain preserved. Never restart a legacy receipt
writer while the publisher is running.

Final public smoke checks after cleanup:
- GET https://mcp.ngx-workshop.io/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp: 200.
- POST https://mcp.ngx-workshop.io/mcp/publishing without credentials: 401.
- POST https://admin.ngx-workshop.io/api/publisher/tools with admin Origin and no credentials: 401.
- OPTIONS on the browser facade with admin Origin: 204.

No paid generation or workshop mutation was used for verification. Real signed-in
administrator history/preparation/publication acceptance remains a separate check.
The gateway's safe preflight diagnostic now names mismatched fields without values;
all six local deployment regression tests pass. That diagnostic/docs change remains
local and was not needed to deploy the already validated artifacts.
